# Microprocessors
A microprocessor or microcontroller is a small computer designed to run one program.<br />
Unlike a computer it has the ability to interact with the world through **General Purpose Input Output (GPIO)** pins.<br />
The GPIO pins allow you to turn check or set a pins voltage. <br />

In this tutorial, we will be using an Arduino Nano. 
This microcontrollor is good as it has:
* A large amount of GPIO's both (analog and digital).
* It can run with a usb power supply from the computer.
* It uses the open source [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) to program it.
* It fits inside a breadboard.







# Circuits
For making circuits, you will be using a breadboard (bellow). <br />
These boards allow you to insert components and connect them through its internal wiring. <br /> 
This wiring is shown in the image to the right (everything in a line is connected). <br/>
